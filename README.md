The application can create, read, update and delete data, for example: products, in a database.

### WebSockets

```
Implemented WebSockets using Socket.IO to allow real-time updates to all connected clients.
Whenever an item is added, updated, or removed from the inventory, In my case, it show changes in the terminal
because I have only implemented backend and it will reflect the change in the terminal.
